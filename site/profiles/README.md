- a profile is where site-specific configuration is injected into commodity component modules, e.g.:
    - we may have retrieved a java module from the forge, but the `profiles::java` class is where we specify which version of java we want installed and where we host it internally
- profiles can declare classes or resources as necessary
- profiles generally implement a "stack" of technologies, respecting the single-reponsibility principle
